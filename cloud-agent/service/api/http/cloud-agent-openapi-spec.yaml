  title: Identus Cloud Agent API Reference
  version: 1.38.0
  description: |2

    The Identus Cloud Agent API facilitates the integration and management of self-sovereign identity capabilities within applications.
    It supports DID (Decentralized Identifiers) management, verifiable credential exchange, and secure messaging based on DIDComm standards.
    The API is designed to be interoperable with various blockchain and DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) platforms, ensuring wide compatibility and flexibility.
    Key features include connection management, credential issuance and verification, and secure, privacy-preserving communication between entities.
    Additional information and the full list of capabilities can be found in the [Open Enterprise Agent documentation](https://docs.atalaprism.io/docs/category/prism-cloud-agent)

- name: Connections Management
  description: |2

    The __Connections Management__ endpoints facilitate the initiation of connection flows between the current Agent and peer Agents, regardless of whether they reside in Cloud Agent or edge environments.
    This implementation adheres to the DIDComm Messaging v2.0 - [Out of Band Messages](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/#out-of-band-messages) specification [section 9.5.4](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/#invitation) - to generate invitations.
    The <b>from</b> field of the out-of-band invitation message contains a freshly generated Peer DID that complies with the [did:peer:2](https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/#generating-a-didpeer2) specification.
    This Peer DID includes the 'uri' location of the DIDComm messaging service, essential for the invitee's subsequent execution of the connection flow.
    Upon accepting an invitation, the invitee sends a connection request to the inviter's DIDComm messaging service endpoint.
    The connection request's 'type' attribute must be specified as "https://atalaprism.io/mercury/connections/1.0/request".
    The inviter agent responds with a connection response message, indicated by a 'type' attribute of "https://atalaprism.io/mercury/connections/1.0/response".
    Both request and response types are proprietary to the Open Enterprise Agent ecosystem.
- name: Issue Credentials Protocol
  description: |2

    The __Issue Credentials Protocol__ endpoints facilitate the initiation of credential issuance flows between the current Agent and peer Agents, regardless of whether they reside in Cloud Agent or edge environments.
    This implementation adheres to the [Issue Credential Protocol 3.0](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-didcomm/tree/main/issue_credential) specification to execute credential issuance flows.
    The flow is initiated by the issuer who creates a [credential offer](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-didcomm/tree/main/issue_credential#offer-credential) and sends it to the holder's DIDComm messaging service endpoint.
    Upon accepting the received offer, the holder sends a [credential request](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-didcomm/tree/main/issue_credential#request-credential) to the issuer.
    The issuer agent will then issue the credential (JWT or AnonCreds) and send an [issue credential](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-didcomm/tree/main/issue_credential#issue-credential) message containing the verifiable credential to the holder.
    The current implementation only supports one of the three alternative beginnings proposed in the spec, which is "the Issuer begin with an offer".
- name: Verification
  description: |2-

    The __Verification__ endpoints enable the management and lookup of verification policies,which are applied to W3C Verifiable Credentials in JWT format.

    Users can retrieve and paginate existing policies or create new ones.
    These policies determine the verification criteria, allowing users to specify constraints such as `schemaId` and `trustedIssuers` in the current implementation.

    The constraints are defined using the `schemaId` and a sequence of `trustedIssuers`.
    This functionality ensures the system's integrity and adherence to specific verification requirements.

    Endpoints are secured by __apiKeyAuth__ or __jwtAuth__ authentication.
- name: Schema Registry
  description: |2

    The __Schema Registry__ is a REST API that allows to publish and lookup credential schemas in [W3C](https://w3c.github.io/vc-json-schema/) and [AnonCreds](https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/#term:schema) formats.

    The Credential Schema is a JSON document that describes the structure of the credential and consists of the following parts: metadata, schema and signature.
    The metadata contains the following fields:
    * `id` - locally unique identifier of the schema
    * `version` - version of the schema
    * `author` - the DID of the issuer of the schema
    * `guid` - globally unique identifier of the schema (generated by the Schema Registry based on `author`, `id` and `version`)
    * `name` - name of the schema
    * `tags` - list of tags that describe the schema
    * `createdAt` - timestamp of the schema creation
    * `description` - description of the schema

    The schema contains the JSON Schema that describes the structure of the credential in the `schema` field
    The signature contains the signature of the schema by the issuer in the `proof` field. The signature is generated by the issuer's DID key using Ed25519Signature2020 method.

    The __Credential Schema__ object is immutable, so update operation creates a new version of the schema.
    The __Credential Schema__ is referenced via `schemaId` field in the issuance and verification flows.

    Endpoints are secured by __apiKeyAuth__ or __jwtAuth__ authentication.

    description: Credential Schema documentation
- name: Credential Definition Registry
  description: |2

    The __Credential Definition Registry__ is a REST API that allows to publish and lookup [Anoncreds Credential Definition](https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/#term:credential-definition) entities.

    A credential definition is generated by the issuer before credential any issuances and published for anyone (primarily holders and verifiers) to use.
    In generating the published credential definition, related private data is also generated and held as a secret by the issuer.
    The secret data includes the private keys necessary to generate signed verifiable credentials that can be presented and verified using the published credential definition.

    Endpoints are secured by __apiKeyAuth__ or __jwtAuth__ authentication.

    description: Credential Definition documentation
- name: DID
  description: |2

    The __DID__ endpoints expose publicly available DID operations.

    The key distinction from the __DID Registrar__ endpoints is that it directly exposes the DID resources interfacing with the [VDR](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verifiable-data-registry).
    It is independent of the key management and the exposed operations are not part of the tenancy within the Agent.
    It serves as a proxy for interacting with the VDR, facilitating actions like resolving DIDs.
- name: DID Registrar
  description: |2

    The __DID Registrar__ endpoints facilitate the management of [PRISM DIDs](https://github.com/input-output-hk/prism-did-method-spec) hosted in the cloud agent.

    Implentation of [DID management](https://docs.atalaprism.io/docs/atala-prism/prism-cloud-agent/did-management/) in the cloud agent.
    The agent securely manages and stores DIDs along with their keys in its secret storage.
    These endpoints allow users to create, read, update, deactivate, and publish without direct exposure to the key material.
    These DIDs can be utilized for various operations during issuance and verification processes.

    More examples and tutorials can be found in this [documentation](https://docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/category/dids/).
- name: Wallet Management
  description: |2

    The __Wallet Management__ endpoints enable both users and administrators to manage [wallets](https://docs.atalaprism.io/docs/concepts/multi-tenancy#wallet).

    In a multitenant agent, wallet is a container for various resources (e.g. Connections, DIDs) and it isolates the access based on the authorization settings.
    [Admnistrator](https://docs.atalaprism.io/docs/concepts/glossary#administrator) can utilize the endpoints to manage and onboard [tenants](https://docs.atalaprism.io/docs/concepts/glossary#tenant).
    See [this example](https://docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/multitenancy/tenant-onboarding-ext-iam) for instructions how to utilize the endpoints for administrator.
    Tenants can also manage and onboard their own wallets using these endpoints depending on the configuration.
    See [this document](https://docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/multitenancy/tenant-onboarding-ext-iam) for a detailed example for self-service tenants onboarding.

    Wallet permissions are controlled by [UMA](https://docs.atalaprism.io/docs/concepts/glossary#uma) configuration which the agent
    exposes endpoints to easily configure wallet access using `uma-permissions` resource.
    The permissions can also be configured out-of-band directly on the external IAM provider that supports the UMA standard.
- name: System
  description: |2

    The __System__ is a REST API that allows to check the system health and scrap the runtime metrics.

    The __health__ endpoint returns the current version of the running service.
    This information can be used to check the health status of the running service in the docker or kubernetes environment.

    The __metrics__ endpoint returns the runtime metrics of the running service scraped from the internal prometheus registry.
    This information is collected by the prometheus server and can be used to monitor the running service.
- name: Events
  description: |
    The __Events__ endpoints enable users to manage event-related resources, such as webhook notifications.
    These notifications are specifically designed to inform about events occurring within the wallet, including but not limited to:

    - DID publication notifications
    - DIDComm connection notifications
    - Issuance protocol notifications
    - Presentation protocol notifications

    For more detailed information regarding event notifications, please refer to this [documentation](https://docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/webhooks/webhook).
- name: Identity and Access Management
  description: |2

    The __Identity and Access Management__ endpoints allow [agent administrators](https://docs.atalaprism.io/docs/concepts/glossary#administrator)
    to manage identity and access management for the agent's tenants.
    It provides basic built-in IAM capabilities as an alternative to more feature rich external IAM solutions.

    Entities are resources that represent individual tenants and
    wallets act as containers for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) resources within the agent.
    The administrator can grant tenant access to specific wallets by associating the wallet ID with the Entity.
    Additionally, the administrator can create API keys for entities and provide them to the tenants out-of-band.
    These API keys can then be used for authorization to access specific wallets.

    For more detailed information related to the agent IAM and its usage, please refer to this [documentation](https://docs.atalaprism.io/docs/atala-prism/prism-cloud-agent/authentication).

        to a peer Agent.
      description: |2

        Create a new connection invitation that can be delivered out-of-band to a peer Agent, regardless of whether it resides in Cloud Agent or edge environment.
        The generated invitation adheres to the DIDComm Messaging v2.0 - [Out of Band Messages](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/#out-of-band-messages) specification [section 9.5.4](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/#invitation).
        The <b>from</b> field of the out-of-band invitation message contains a freshly generated Peer DID that complies with the [did:peer:2](https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/#generating-a-didpeer2) specification.
        This Peer DID includes the 'uri' location of the DIDComm messaging service, essential for the invitee's subsequent execution of the connection flow.
        In the Agent database, the created connection record has an initial state set to `InvitationGenerated`.
        The request body may contain a `label` that can be used as a human readable alias for the connection, for example `{'label': "Connection with Bob"}`

      description: |2

        Accept an new connection invitation received out-of-band from another peer Agent.
        The invitation must be compliant with the DIDComm Messaging v2.0 - [Out of Band Messages](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/#out-of-band-messages) specification [section 9.5.4](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/#invitation).
        A new connection record with state `ConnectionRequestPending` will be created in the agent database and later processed by a background job to send a connection request to the peer Agent.
        The created record will contain a newly generated pairwise Peer DID used for that connection.
        A connection request will then be sent to the peer Agent to actually establish the connection, moving the record state to `ConnectionRequestSent`, and waiting the connection response from the peer Agent.

        The publishing process is asynchronous.
        Attempting to publish the same DID while the previous publication is ongoing will not initiate another publication.
        After the submission of the DID publication, its status is changed to `PUBLICATION_PENDING`.
        Upon confirmation after a predefined number of blocks, the status is changed to `PUBLISHED`.
        In case of a failed DID publication, the status is reverted to `CREATED`.
