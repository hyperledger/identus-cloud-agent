      summary: Resolve a DID / dereference a DID URL.
      description:
        <p>This endpoint resolves a DID. As input it takes the DID, plus DID resolution
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-resolution-options">options</a>. The output is a DID
        document
        in one of the supported representations, plus metadata. The same endpoint can also be used to dereference a DID
        URL. In this case, the output is a DID document, or part of a DID document, or some other resource identified
        by the DID URL.</p>
