# Issue credentials (DIDComm)

In the Identus Platform, the [Issue Credentials Protocol](/docs/concepts/glossary#issue-credential-protocol) allows you
to create, retrieve, and manage issued [verifiable credentials (VCs)](/docs/concepts/glossary#verifiable-credentials)
between a VC issuer and a VC holder.

## Roles

In the Issue Credentials Protocol, there are two roles:

1. The [Issuer](/docs/concepts/glossary#issuer) is responsible for creating a new credential offer, sending it to a
   Holder, and issuing the VC once the offer is accepted.
2. The [Holder](/docs/concepts/glossary#holder) is responsible for accepting a credential offer from an issuer and
   receiving the VC.

The Issuer and Holder interact with the Identus Cloud Agent API to perform the operations defined in the protocol.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Issuing Credentials protocol, the following conditions must be present:

<Tabs groupId="vc-formats">
<TabItem value="jwt" label="JWT">

1. Issuer and Holder Cloud Agents up and running
2. A connection must be established between the Issuer and Holder Cloud Agents (
   see [Connections](../../connections/connection.md))
3. The Issuer must have a published PRISM DID, and the [DID document](/docs/concepts/glossary#did-document) must have at
   least one `assertionMethod` key for issuing credentials (see [Create DID](../../dids/create.md)
   and [Publish DID](../../dids/publish.md))
4. The Issuer must have created a VC schema as described [here](../../schemas/create.md).
5. The Holder must have a PRISM DID, and the DID document must have at least one `authentication` key for presenting the
   proof.

## Overview

The protocol described is a VC issuance process between two Identus Cloud Agents, the Issuer and the Holder.

The protocol consists of the following main parts:

1. The Issuer creates a new credential offer using
   the [`/issue-credentials/credential-offers`](/agent-api/#tag/Issue-Credentials-Protocol/operation/createCredentialOffer)
   endpoint, which includes information such as the schema identifier and claims.
2. The Holder can then retrieve the offer using
   the [`/issue-credentials/records`](/agent-api/#tag/Issue-Credentials-Protocol/operation/getCredentialRecords)
   endpoint and accept the offer using
   the [`/issue-credentials/records/{recordId}/accept-offer`](/agent-api/#tag/Issue-Credentials-Protocol/operation/acceptCredentialOffer)
   endpoint.
3. The Issuer then uses
   the [`/issue-credentials/records/{recordId}/issue-credential`](/agent-api/#tag/Issue-Credentials-Protocol/operation/issueCredential)
   endpoint to issue the credential, which gets sent to the Holder via [DIDComm](/docs/concepts/glossary#didcomm). The
   Holder receives the credential, and the protocol is complete.

The claims provide specific information about the individual, such as their name or qualifications.

This protocol is applicable in various real-life scenarios, such as educational credentialing, employment verification,
and more.
In these scenarios, the Issuer could be a school, an employer, etc., and the Holder could be a student or an employee.
The VCs issued during this protocol could represent a diploma, a certificate of employment, etc.

## Issuer interactions

This section describes the Issuer role's available interactions with the Cloud Agent.

### Creating a Credential Offer

To start the process, the issuer needs to create a credential offer.
To do this, make a `POST` request to
the [`/issue-credentials/credential-offers`](/agent-api/#tag/Issue-Credentials-Protocol/operation/createCredentialOffer)
endpoint with a JSON payload that includes the following information:

<Tabs groupId="vc-formats">
<TabItem value="jwt" label="JWT">
**NOTE**: After v1.40.0 the API was changed to be compliant with VCDM 1.1 and group the JWT-VC properties in the object `jwtVcPropertiesV1`

1. `claims` (deprecated): The data stored in a verifiable credential. Claims get expressed in a key-value format. The
   claims contain the data that the issuer attests to, such as name, address, date of birth, and so on.
2. `jwtVcPropertiesV1.claims`: The data stored in a verifiable credential. Claims get expressed in a key-value format.
   The claims contain the data that the issuer attests to, such as name, address, date of birth, and so on.
3. `issuingDID` (deprecated): The DID referring to the issuer to issue this credential from.
4. `jwtVcPropertiesV1.issuingDID`: The DID referring to the issuer to issue this credential from.
5. `jwtVcPropertiesV1.issuingKid`: The key ID of the DID to sign the JWT VC.
6. `jwtVcPropertiesV1.validityPeriod`: The validity period of the JWT VC in seconds.
7. `connectionId`: The unique ID of the connection between the holder and the issuer to offer this credential over.
8. `schemaId` (deprecated): An optional field that, if specified, contains a valid URL to an existing VC schema.
9. `jwtVcPropertiesV1.credentialSchema.id`: The required field that, if specified, contains a valid URI to an existing
   VC schema.
10. `jwtVcPropertiesV1.credentialSchema.type`: The required field that must equal to `JsonSchemaValidator2018`
11. `credentialFormat`: The format of the credential that will be issued - `JWT` in this case. When not specified, the
    default value is `JWT`.

:::note
The `issuingDID` and `connectionId` properties come from completing the pre-requisite steps listed above
:::

Once the request initiates, a new credential record for the issuer gets created with a unique ID. The state of this
record is now `OfferPending`.

### Sending the Offer to the Holder

The next step for the Issuer is to send the offer to the holder using DIDComm.
To do this, the Issuer agent will process the offer and send it to the holder agent.
This process is automatic. The state of the Issuer's record will change to `OfferSent`.

### Issuing the Credential

Once the holder has approved the offer and sent a request to the Issuer,
the Issuer will receive the request via DIDComm and update the record state to `RequestReceived.`

The Issuer can then use
the [`/issue-credentials/records/{recordId}/issue-credential`](/agent-api/#tag/Issue-Credentials-Protocol/operation/issueCredential)
endpoint to issue the credential to the holder.

```shell
# Issuer POST request to issue the credential
# make sure you have `issuer_record_id` extracted from created credential offer
# and the record achieved `RequestReceived` state
curl -X POST \
    "http://localhost:8080/cloud-agent/issue-credentials/records/$issuer_record_id/issue-credential" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "apikey: $API_KEY"
```

When this endpoint gets called, the state of the record will change to `CredentialPending,` and after processing, it
will change to `CredentialGenerated.`

Finally, the Issuer agent will send the credential to the holder via DIDComm,
and the state of the record will change to `CredentialSent`.
At this point, the Issuer's interactions with the holder are complete.

```mermaid

  [*] --> OfferPending: create credential offer (`/issue-credentials/credential-offers`)
  OfferPending --> OfferSent: send offer (auto via Cloud Agent DIDComm)

```

## Holder interactions

This section describes the Holder role's available interactions with the Cloud Agent.

### Receiving the VC Offer

The Holder will receive the offer from the Issuer via DIDComm,
and a new credential record with a unique ID gets created in the `OfferReceived` state.

This process is automatic for the Cloud Agent.

You could check if a new credential offer is available
using [`/issue-credentials/records`](/#tag/Issue-Credentials-Protocol/operation/getCredentialRecords) request and check
for any records available in `OfferReceived` state:

```shell
# Holder GET request to retrieve credential records
curl "http://localhost:8090/cloud-agent/issue-credentials/records" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "apikey: $API_KEY"
```

### Approving the VC Offer

To accept the offer, the Holder can make a `POST` request to
the [`/issue-credentials/records/{recordId}/accept-offer`](/agent-api/#tag/Issue-Credentials-Protocol/operation/acceptCredentialOffer)
endpoint with a JSON payload that includes the following information:

<Tabs groupId="vc-formats">
<TabItem value="jwt" label="JWT">

1. `holder_record_id`: The unique identifier of the issue credential record known by the holder's Cloud Agent.
2. `subjectId`: This field represents the unique identifier for the subject of the verifiable credential. It is a
   short-form PRISM [DID](/docs/concepts/glossary#decentralized-identifier) string, such
   as `did:prism:subjectIdentifier`.

1. `holder_record_id`: The unique identifier of the issue credential record known by the holder's Cloud Agent.
2. `subjectId`: This field represents the unique identifier for the subject of the verifiable credential. It is a
   short-form PRISM [DID](/docs/concepts/glossary#decentralized-identifier) string, such
   as `did:prism:subjectIdentifier`.
3. `keyId` Option parameter
    1. when keyId is not provided the SDJWT VC is not binded to Holder/Prover key

    2. `keyId`: This is optional field but must be specified to choose which key bounds to the verifiable credential.
       For more information on
       key-binding, [ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt).
       Currently, we only support the EdDSA algorithm and curve Ed25519.
       The specified keyId should be of type Ed25519.
       The purpose of the keyId should be authentication.

   ```shell

This request will change the state of the record to `RequestPending`.

### Receiving the VC Credential

Once the Holder has approved the offer and sent a request to the Issuer, the Holder agent will process the request and
send it to the Issuer agent.
The state of the Holder's record will change to `RequestSent`.

After the Issuer has issued the credential, the Holder will receive the credential via DIDComm, and the state of the
Holder's record will change to `CredentialReceived`.
This process is automatic for the Cloud Agent.

The Holder can check the achieved credential using a GET request
to [`/issue-credentials/records/{recordId}/`](/agent-api/#tag/Issue-Credentials-Protocol/operation/getCredentialRecord)
endpoint.
