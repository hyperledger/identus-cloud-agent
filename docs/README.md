# Identus Cloud Agent Documentation

This is the landing page for the Cloud Agent technical documentation set.

## OpenAPI Specifications

### Source files
- The OpenAPI specification for a **service** building block is written in YAML format.
- Each building block is responsible for making its YAML spec available to other parties via HTTP GET on one of its service endpoints.

### Visualisation

[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) is used and allows development teams and service consumers to visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resources
without having any of the implementation logic in place. It is automatically generated from the OpenAPI specification.

Swagger UI is available as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/swaggerapi/swagger-ui).

## Run locally with Docker Compose

The following [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file can be used to run both services in one shot by executing the following command from the repo's root folder:

```bash
docker-compose -f docs/docker-compose.yml up
```
- OpenAPI specifications doc is available *localhost:8081*
