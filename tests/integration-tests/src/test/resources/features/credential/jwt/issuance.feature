    And Issuer adds a '<assertionMethod>' key for 'assertionMethod' purpose with '<assertionName>' name to the custom PRISM DID
    And Issuer creates the custom PRISM DID
    And Issuer publishes DID to ledger
    When Issuer offers a jwt credential to Holder with 'short' form DID using issuingKid '<assertionName>' and STUDENT_SCHEMA schema
    And Holder receives the credential offer
    And Holder accepts jwt credential offer using 'auth-1' key id
    And Issuer issues the credential
    Then Holder receives the issued credential
    Examples:
      | assertionMethod | assertionName |
      | secp256k1       | assert-1      |
      | ed25519         | assert-1      |
